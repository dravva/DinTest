    <p><b>MICROSOFT LIMITED PUBLIC LICENSE.</b></p>

    <p>This license governs use of code marked as "sample" or "example" available on this web site without a license agreement, as provided under the section above titled "NOTICE SPECIFIC TO SOFTWARE AVAILABLE ON THIS WEB SITE." If you use such code (the "software"), you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.</p>

    <p>1. Definitions </p>

    <p>The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.</p>

    <p>A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.</p>

    <p>A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.</p>

    <p>"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.</p>

    <p>2. Grant of Rights </p>

    <p>(A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.</p>

    <p>(B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.</p>

    <p>3. Conditions and Limitations </p>

    <p>(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.</p>

    <p>(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.</p>

    <p>(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.</p>

    <p>(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.</p>

    <p>(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

    <p>(F) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B) extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run on a Microsoft Windows operating system product.</p>

    <p><a class="bkMkTop" href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>

    <p><b>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES </b></p>

    <p>This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF 
    YOUR, MICROSOFT'S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term "dispute" means any dispute, 
    action, or other controversy between you and Microsoft concerning the services (including their price) or this agreement, 
    whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. "Dispute" will
    be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Notice of Dispute.</b>  In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, US. A form is
        available on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/copyright/default.aspx?LinkId=245499">Legal and Corporate Affairs (LCA)</a> website (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499). Microsoft will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and Microsoft will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from
        the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or Microsoft may commence arbitration.</li>
        <li><b>Small claims court.</b> You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or King County, Washington, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.</li>
        <li><b>Binding arbitration.</b> <b>If you and Microsoft don't resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.</b>
        Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.</li>
        <li><b>Class action waiver.</b> <b>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Microsoft will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without
        the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</b></li>
        <li><b>Arbitration procedure.</b> Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If you are an individual and use the services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the services, its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will also apply. For more information,
        see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/copyright/default.aspx?LinkId=248505">American Arbitration Association</a> website (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248505) or call 1-800-778-7879. To commence arbitration, submit the form available on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/copyright/default.aspx?LinkId=245497">Legal and Corporate Affairs (LCA)</a> website (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497)
        to the AAA. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in King County, Washington, US. Microsoft agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually
        as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>
        <li><p><b>Arbitration fees and incentives.</b></p> 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Disputes involving $75,000 or less.</b> Microsoft will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. If you reject Microsoft's last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed ("Microsoft's last written offer"), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator's decision (called an "award"), and the arbitrator awards you more than
                Microsoft's last written offer, Microsoft will give you three incentives: (a) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (b) pay twice your reasonable attorney's fees, if any; and (c) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Microsoft agree on them.</li>
                <li><b>Disputes involving more than $75,000.</b> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses.</li>
                <li><b>Disputes involving any amount.</b> In any arbitration you commence, Microsoft will seek its AAA or arbitrator's fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. In any arbitration Microsoft commences, Microsoft will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator's fees and expenses. Microsoft won't
                seek its attorney's fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a dispute involves.</li>
                <li><b>Conflict with AAA rules.</b> This agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.</li>
                <li><b>Claims or disputes must be filed within one year.</b> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court, an arbitration proceeding, or in court, if the "Severability" section permits the dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute isn't filed
                within one year, it's permanently barred.</li>
                <li><b>Severability.</b> If the class action waiver in the "Class Action Waiver" section is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then this "Binding Arbitration" section won't apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this "Binding Arbitration" section is found to be illegal or
                unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this "Binding Arbitration" section remaining in full force and effect.</li>
